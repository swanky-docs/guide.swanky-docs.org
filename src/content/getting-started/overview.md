### What is Swanky Docs?
Swanky Docs is a framework that enables you to create beautiful documentation from any source that you can provide it with. Swanky Docs can be viewed as a type of static site generator that has been specifically focused on doing one thing well - __documentation__. Swanky Docs can be used to create __API documentation__, Living __Pattern Libraries__ or maybe a combination of both. There really is no limit to what you can document with Swanky Docs.

### Why Swanky Docs Over Other Documentation Tools?
A project can have many different contributors all collaborating to achieve a single outcome. Good documentation that captures the requirements and outputs of all these contributing team members can be a very powerful tool in surfacing this information to benefit everyone. Swanky Docs has been designed to allow for this flexibility and adapt to your project teams specific requirements, whether it be a single developer/designer or a widespread project team across an entire organisation.

Unlike other documentation tools Swanky Docs does not enforce a specific way of writing documentation or require you to use any custom markup. Swanky Docs embraces how you already make your documentation e.g. *markdown files*, *comments in your code*, *documentation on github*... With the flexibility and power of Swanky Docs __processors__ you can capture any source and turn it into beautiful documentation.
